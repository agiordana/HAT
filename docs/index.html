<P ALIGN=LEFT>The original purpose of the project was to provide a
platform useful to students and teachers for  developing student labs
in the area of IoT (Internet of Things) and Home Automation, using
low cost hardware such as <A HREF="https://beagleboard.org/black">Beaglebone
Back</A> or <A HREF="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry PI</A>.
The idea was to provide a library, easy to install on this kind of
hosts, supporting the quick development of simple applications in
order to introduce students into the IoT domain. The choice was to
adopt C++ as basic programming language that is still very performant
on low power hosts while providing a powerful object oriented
paradigm.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>In order to provide an environment highly modular easy
to modify and to encourage the student to explore network programming
HAT supports an agent based architecture, which stay at the origin of
the project name. In fact, HAT is the acronym of “Home Agent Team”.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>HAT agents runs as Linux processes <FONT FACE="NimbusRomNo9L"><FONT SIZE=2>distributed
on hosts interconnected by a TCP/IP local network </FONT></FONT>and
cooperate  <FONT FACE="NimbusRomNo9L"><FONT SIZE=2>by exchanging
messages encoded according to a <A HREF="http://www.restapitutorial.com/">restful</A>
protocol. Moreover, they provide a self-configuration protocol
inspired to <A HREF="http://www.zeroconf.org/">zeroconf</A>.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="NimbusRomNo9L"><FONT SIZE=2>A comprehensive
description of HAT architecture ca be found in the <A HREF="HAT-Architecture.pdf">project
documentation</A>.</FONT></FONT></P>:q

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="NimbusRomNo9L"><FONT SIZE=2>Beyond the
initial goal, HAT is now grown up and provides not only a development
environment but also a set of stable agents, which provide most
functionalities, usually required in the home automation domain,
which can be used to implment self-made smart utilities, such as
anti-intrusion systems, energy monitoring and management, and so on.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="NimbusRomNo9L"><FONT SIZE=2>Moreover, the
agent architecture can be easy extended in ored to integrate agent
implemented in programming language different from C++, such as Java
or Pyton. The interested user may find examples of this kind of
solution in several <A HREF="https://github.com/aledani/BBAlarm">student
lab</A>, also made publicly available.</FONT></FONT></P>
